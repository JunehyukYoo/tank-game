The project I want to do is to recreate a version based off the old NES tank games. The game would involve two tanks that players can control on one computer. There will be move keys and a shoot key. The shoot key will shoot a ball that "kills" the opponent on impact. There will be randomly generated map or a map chosen out of a pool with barriers and walls. There will be consumable items that can buff players. The player would shoot in the direction last travelled. In order to win, the player would have to score a total of 10 points by defeating the opponent 10 times. Any changes to the map will be kept between deaths.

The reason I want to pursue this project is because I am a big fan of games, and I explicitly remember playing the old tank game back in early elementary school with friends. Being able to create my own version of this using Cinder would be absolutely amazing. 

A rough timeline would be:

Week 1|Week 2|Week 3
-------|------|------
Create the characters that can move across an empty screen. Add in bullets that can "kill" the opponent that shoot in the same direction the tank last moved. Add in a score keeping system that displays on the screen. Spawn tanks in their respective corners. | Add in the map(s) which may or may not change with bullet impact. Make it so that bullets and tanks cannot go through the walls. Implement a win screen. | Add in images for tanks, textures for walls, etc. Add in consumable that makes bullets bounce off a certain amount of walls.

Stretch Goals:
Be able to randomly generate maps. Implement extra consumables, eg: survive an extra shot. Add in special types of walls that are destructible.
